### SLO Thrift User Description Change Example Flow
Jin is an avid user of SLO Thrift. One day he realizes that the description of a particular thrift store is not up to date with its current inventory. First, Jin requests to see all the thrift stores on the website by calling GET /stores. Jin sees that a particular store has the wrong type of goods. Jin then initiates a request to update the store description. To do so he calls POST /descriptions/update/{store_id} and passes in the dictionary of what descriptors he wants to have changed. The description then changes and Jin is happy :)
