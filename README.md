# SLO_Thrift

This project will be a web applications for people to post and rate thrift stores in the San Luis Obispo area. Users will be able to post ratings for thrift stores, look for the best rated thrift stores in the area, and post images of their own outfits made from visiting these thrift stores. This project aims to be helpful to members of the Cal Poly thrift club as a form of a discussion board as well as a collection of thrift stores that people may want to visit.
